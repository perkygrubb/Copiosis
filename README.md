2. Before starting work on a new feature, enhancement, or fix, please create an issue and optionally assign it to yourself or a developer.  
3.	Fork the repository and make your changes against the 'development' branch (not master).  
4.	After making your changes in your fork, run tests and ensure that the page looks good and works with all supported browsers.  
5.	If you have made a series of commits into the 'development' branch, please try to squash them into a small number of commits.  
6.	Issue a Pull Request against the 'development' branch (not master).

8.	Upon acceptance, your code will be merged into the master branch and will become available for all.  


Pardon our organization as we're just beginning to use GitHub and are figuring things out. More information on the way.
